# UsedCarPrediction
## Project description
This project involved exploring the dataset provided here on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harikrishnareddyb/used-car-price-predictions. The project dealt with developing a machine-learning model to predict the price of used cars based on the provided dataset. The beginning of the project involved EDA, where the different features were explored and visualized. Outliers were removed, and additional features were derived from the provided columns. Additionally, I tried several machine learning models, but XGBOOST regression performed the best. Furthermore, the categorical features were encoded using LabelEncoding. I choose LabelEncoding instead of OneHotEncoding to prevent a sparse matrix. Lastly, I did hyperparameter tuning to achieve a better RMSE score for my XGBOOST model.
